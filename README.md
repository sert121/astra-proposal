# Time-travelling with Language models.

Each file pertains to the task described in the spec-sheet by Owain Evans. 
In task 1, the experiment mostly focuses on designing one classification task that the language model performs really well. The classification task pertains successfully finding any sentence that refers to an instance of time (month,day,year, occurence).
In task 2 and 3, we test the model's abilties to come up rules that explain the classification intention/logic, and the faithfulness of the model to stick with its reasoning when provided with other valid rules.
